## How to Read Documentation

Reading docs is a skill.

## How to Read Documentation Effectively

1. **Identify the purpose**  
   Understand what the module, function, or class is meant to do.

2. **Look at examples first**  
   Examples show usage and help you grasp concepts quickly.

3. **Check function signatures**  
   Note parameters, return types, and optional arguments.

4. **Understand exceptions/errors**  
   Know what errors to expect and how to handle them.

5. **Use search and indexing**  
   Use Ctrl+F or the table of contents to find relevant sections.

6. **Refer to related topics**  
   Documentation often links to related functions or concepts.

7. **Practice with code**  
   Write small scripts testing new functions as you read.

8. **Use official sources**  
   Prefer official docs (like https://docs.python.org/) for accuracy.

# Loop over a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0 to 4

# Range with start, stop, step
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 2, 4, 6, 8

# Loop over a string
for char in "python":
    print(char)

# Loop over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Loop with index using enumerate
for index, value in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, value)


# Nested loops

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)

# Loop over a tuple
coords = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4)]

# Loop over a set (unordered)

# Loop over a dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key} â†’ {value}")


# For loop with else
# else block runs only if loop completes normally (no break)
for fruit in fruits:

# Generator style loop (collecting results)

# Equivalent to:
# squares = [x * x for x in range(5)]

# py-cs-zero-to-one

A hands-on journey to learn **computer science foundations** while learning **Python** programming.

This project is built around **small, self-contained Python files** that progressively introduce you to CS concepts using just enough Python at each step to support the learning.

## Purpose

This project is a road map for anyone who:

- Wants to learn **Computer Science** with practical, runnable Python examples.
- Is a beginner or self-taught programmer looking to **build strong fundamentals**.
- Prefers **bite-sized `.py` files** with comments and clear progression over large tutorials or dense theory.
- Wants to be able to pause and resume at any point without losing context.

If you have a CS topic you would like explained in Python or a pattern that helped you learn, feel free to open an issue or share a `.py` example to add.

## Philosophy

- **Zero to One**: Go from no CS background to having solid foundational knowledge.
- **Code-first learning**: Every concept is demonstrated through runnable Python code.
- **Layered complexity**: Start from absolute basics, and build up gradually.
- **Practical and minimal**: Focus only on the CS topics and Python syntax you *need* to know.

## Structure

This project is supposed to be always work in progress and grow over time. The structure is designed to make it easy to:
- Contribute new `.py` examples
- Add more CS topics
- Extend or adapt to any learning pace
